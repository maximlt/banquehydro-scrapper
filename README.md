# [WIP] A scrapper for the Banque Hydro

The french national database providing hydro-data, aka the [Banque Hydro](http://hydro.eaufrance.fr/) can be painful to use sometimes. This scrapper allows to quickly download data from the database that would need a long time, possibly hours of work, to accomplish by hand. It includes:

- Full daily flow time series at single gage
- More to come
